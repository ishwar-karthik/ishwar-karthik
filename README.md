- 👋 Hi, I’m @ishwar-karthik
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but currently mostly maths (especially mathematical finance), AI, and physics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a third-year undergrad maths student at the University of Oxford who dabbles in coding when needed for various projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving any sort of intricate logical or mathematical machinery behind the scenes.
- 📫 How to reach me - ishwarkarthik@gmail.com is my email. I have other contact details too, but they change all the time and I might not be active on all of them always.
